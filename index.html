			Her fourth album, Red (2012), yielded the successful singles 
			"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" and "I Knew You Were Trouble". With her fifth album, 
			the pop-focused 1989 (2014), she became the first act to have three albums sell a million copies within 
			one week in the United States. Its singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood" reached number 
			one in the US, Australia, and Canada. The album received three Grammy Awards, and Swift became the first 
			woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice. The 2015 concert tour for 1989 became one of 
			the highest-grossing of the decade. Swift's sixth album, Reputation (2017) and its lead single 
			"Look What You Made Me Do" topped the UK and US charts.</p>
